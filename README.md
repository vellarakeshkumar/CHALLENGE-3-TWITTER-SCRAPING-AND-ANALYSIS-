# CHALLENGE-3-TWITTER-SCRAPING-AND-ANALYSIS-


Hi,

Hope you are doing well. Thank you for providing me an opportunity to do the coding challenge.
I have done the coding challenge with python, I have created a document which states the the approach i have taken to do the coding challenge

How to run the application

Step 1: Unzip the application 
Step 2: "cd scrape_twitter" (run the command from command prompt)
Step 3: run the command   "pip install -r requirements.txt" (to install all the required libraries)
Step 4: Python  manage.py runserver (run the command from command prompt)
Step 4: Go to browser and run the following urls

https://127.0.01:8000/scrapy/retweets  when this url is ran following data is displayed

I have created an application for one city(geolocation). We can add more but I have developed the application on my personal laptop which cannot handle more cities, on dedicated instances we can run as many geolocations as we want.

Please see the views.py python file in the zipped application where the entire developed code is available

I have an issue while pushing the application into github link you provided, it is throwing error saying insufficient permissions hence i am attaching the application with this email

Please see the attached document for architecture and dataflow as well as the zipped application file and let me know if you have any questions .
